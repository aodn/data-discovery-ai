        "# ML model for Keyword Classification - Tech Notebook\n",
        "This notebook introduces (1) how to explore, prepare and preprocess the datasets; (2) how to train and evaluate the ML model; and (3) how to use this trained ML model, for technical audiences.\n",
        "## Problem Description\n",
        "The AODN catalogue $C=\\{M, K, P\\}$ serves as a platform for storing datasets and their associated metadata. $M=\\{m_1,m_2,\\ldots, m_x\\}$ is a set of metadata records which are used to describe the dataset in AODN catalogue $C$. $K=\\{k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_y\\}$ is a set of pre-defined keywords that are used to categorise dataset. In the catalogue $C = \\{M, K\\}$, a subset of metadata records, $M_t \\subseteq M$, have not yet been categorised with keywords. For these records, $K_i = \\emptyset $ for all $m_i \\in M_t$. Given another subset of metadata records, $M_s \\subseteq M$, where each record has already been categorised with keywords (i.e., $K_i \\neq \\emptyset $ for all $m_i \\in M_s$). The research question is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "How to design and develop a machine learning model, denoted as $MM_{keywords}$, that can automatically label the uncategorised metadata records $M_t$ using a predefined set of keywords $K$. Specifically, the model should be trained to learn a mapping rule $d_i \\mapsto K_i$ based on the observed patterns from the sample set $M_s$, where each description $d_i$ of a metadata record $m_i \\in M_s$ is associated with a set of keywords $K_i$. Once trained, the model should be able to apply this learned mapping to accurately categorise the records in $M_t$ by assigning their corresponding keywords based on the records' descriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "To simplify the task, we restrict the scope of keywords to those falling within the primary AODN vocabulary:\n",
        "- AODN Instrument Vocabulary\n",
        "- AODN Discovery Parameter Vocabulary\n",
        "- AODN Platform Vocabulary\n",
        "\n",
        "Only keywords $k_j \\in K_i$ that are part of the listed AODN vocabularies will be considered. Any keyword not belonging to these vocabularies will be excluded from $K_i$ for all metadata records in the categorised metadata set $M_s$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Formal Definitions\n",
        "- **Definition 1: A metadata record $m_i=(d_i, K_i), m_i \\in M$** is a record describing a dataset. Specifically, $i$ is the unique identifier of the record. $d_i$ is a textual abstract that serves as the description of the dataset. $K_i \\subseteq K$ is a subset of keywords used to label the dataset.\n",
        "- **Definition 2: A abstract $d_i$** is a piece of textual information which is used to describe the dataset. The embedding $\\mathbf{d_i}$ is a vector representation of the textual description $d_i$, calculated using the \"bert-base-uncased\" model. The embedding vector $\\mathbf{d_i}$ for each abstract $d_i$ has an universal dimensionality, denoted as $dim=|\\mathbf{d_i}|$. A feature matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ of a shape $|M_s| \\times dim$ aggregates the embeddings for the abstacts of all samples in $M_s$, where |M_s is the total number of metadata records.\n",
        "- **Definition 3: A keyword $k_j$** is a predefined label used for catogarising datasets. Each metadata record $m_i$ is associated with a set of keywords $K_i \\subseteq K$, while $K$ is the complete set of predefined keywords. The keywords $K_i$ for a metadata record $m_i$ is mathematiacally represented as a binary vector $y_i$ with a size of $|K|$. where each element indicates the presence or absence of a specific label. A value of 1 at position $j$ denotes the label $k_j \\in K$ is present in the metadata record $m_i$, in this sence $k_j \\in K_i$, while a value of 0 indicates its absence. A target matrix $\\mathbf{Y}$ is a $|M_s| \\times |K|$ binary matrix, where $|M_s|$ is the size of the metadata records set $M_s=\\{m_1,m_2,\\ldots, m_x\\}$, and $|K|$ is the size of the keywords set $K=\\{k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_y\\}$. Each entry $ \\mathbf{K}[i, j] $ is 1 if metadata record $ m_i $ is associated with keyword $ k_j $, and 0 otherwise.\n",
